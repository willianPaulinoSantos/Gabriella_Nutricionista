I developed this project while I was taking the 'JavaScript: programming web language' course, in Develop program of Boticario's tech group. 
Basically, it provides a table with patience data and calculate the IMC of them. The user can remove, add and filter any patience in database. 
It also checks the input data and shows errors messages if something is wrong.
